# HeartDisease
A project for second-year college course, that strives to classify and calculate the risk of developing heart diesase using classification and regression algorithms.

## Built with
Jupyter Notebook

Python

Kaggle.com

## Process
- Using a dataset from Kaggle.com consisting over 900 subjects
- Creating another dataset consisting 825 subjects with balanced ratio in the target feature.
- Working on both datasets to determine which dataset produced better results between the two.
- Using multiple Classification and Regression algorithms and comparing them.
- Finding the best train/test ratio split.
- Finding the most important features.

## Conclusion
- The original dataset provided better accuracy results, when the highest is 94.6% accuracy on a single test and 86.7% cross validated accuracy.
- The best classification algorithm for this dataset is the Random Forest alogrithm:
